namespace pdg { /**

\fn pdg::argv

\brief contains the arguments passed on the command line

If this was launched by being double-clicked, or on the command line with no arguments, then it will contain:

    [ "/path/to/pdg", "main.js" ]

pdg.argv[0] will always be the path to the pdg application.
There will always be a .js file on the path, even if one wasn't specifically passed in main.js will be added.

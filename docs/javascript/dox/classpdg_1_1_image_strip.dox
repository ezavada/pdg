\class ImageStrip
\brief bitmap image containing a number of frames that can be blitted onto the screen

\note **API Stability: 2 - Unstable**. The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable.

You can create an image strip directly from a file, or by loading it from resource files with the ResourceManager.

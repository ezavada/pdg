\fn pdg::Serializer::serializedSize(boolean)

\brief get the number of bytes used to serialize the given boolean

Does not actually write any data to stream

\return the number of bytes needed (0 or 1)

\note this will often return 0, which simply means that the particular boolean bit is being stored along with other boolean bits in a previously reserved space in the stream, so no additional bytes were needed

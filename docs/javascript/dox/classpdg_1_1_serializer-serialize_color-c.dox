\brief serialize a Color

Write a Color's RBGA values into the data stream.

\warning the Color is written as a 24 (no alpha channel) or 32 bit color (with alpha channel). If you need to preserve greater color precision than this, you will need to serialize the components yourself.

\note data size: varies, call serializedSize(Color) to determine

\sa serializedSize(Color)
\sa Deserializer.deserialize_color()

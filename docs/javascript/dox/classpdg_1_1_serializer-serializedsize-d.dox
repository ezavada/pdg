\fn pdg::Serializer::serializedSize(Offset)

\brief get the number of bytes used to serialize the given Offset

Does not actually write any data to stream

\return the number of bytes needed (0-9)

\note this can return 0 for an offset whose value is (0,0), since a zero offset is optimized to be stored as a single bit.

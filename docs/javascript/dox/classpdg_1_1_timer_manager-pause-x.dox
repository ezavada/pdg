\fn pdg::TimerManager::pause

\brief pause all timers indefinitely

Pause all timers in the TimerManager until unpause() or unpauseTimer() are called. When unpaused they continue their behavior as if no time had passed between the pause() and unpause() calls.

\note timers added *after* pause() is called are not paused and will run as normal.

\sa unpause()
\sa unpauseTimer()
\sa isPaused()

\brief set event handler for sprite offscreen event

These happen when a sprite moves completely outside the visible area of the port the layer is being rendered in, but only if setWantsOffscreenEvents(true) is called for that sprite.

\sa SpriteAnimateEvent
\sa IEventHandler
\sa Sprite.setWantsOffscreenEvents()

\fn pdg::NetConnection::onClose

\brief set callback to handle connection closing

Whenever a network connection is dropped by the remote end (whether cleanly or abrubtly), you will get an onClose callback to the function specified.

\param callback the function that should be called

\todo no parameters are passed to the onClose callback but we should probably indicate if it was an error and pass a reference to the connection object

\brief set up callback for handling errors

These will be errors with the listening port, not with the connections themselves; those go to the connection object. The exception is IP mismatch on incoming connections -- those don't generate any errors to avoid spending unnecessary resources in the event of denial of service attacks.

\param  callback the callback function to be notified of errors

\return itself for call chaining

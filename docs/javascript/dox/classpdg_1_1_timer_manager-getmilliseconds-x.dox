namespace pdg { /**

\fn pdg::TimerManager::getMilliseconds

\brief get the current time in milliseconds

Gets the current millisecond time, from an arbitrary base time prior to the application start. 

\note Many events and callbacks pass this value (or a ms delta since the last call), so you can often avoid repeated calls to getMilliseconds() by using the value or millisecond delta passed in.

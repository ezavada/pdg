\fn pdg::CpSpace::setCollisionBias

\brief set the percentage of overlap between colliding bodies that is left unfixed after each step

From cpSpace comments:

    Determines how fast overlapping shapes are pushed apart.
    Expressed as a fraction of the error remaining after each second.
    Defaults to pow(1.0 - 0.1, 60.0) meaning that Chipmunk fixes 10% of overlap each frame at 60Hz

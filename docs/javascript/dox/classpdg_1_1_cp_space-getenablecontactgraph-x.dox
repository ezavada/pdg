\fn pdg::CpSpace::getEnableContactGraph

\brief get if contact graph is rebuilt during each step

From Chipmunk cpSpace comments: 

    Must be enabled to use the cpBodyEachArbiter() function. 
    Disabled by default for a small performance boost. 
    Enabled implicitly when the sleeping feature is enabled.

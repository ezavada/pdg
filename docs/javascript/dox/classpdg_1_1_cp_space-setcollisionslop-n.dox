\fn pdg::CpSpace::setCollisionSlop

\brief set allowed amount of overlap between shapes

    Amount of encouraged penetration between colliding shapes.
    Used to reduce oscillating contacts and keep the collision cache warm.
    Defaults to 0.1. If you have poor simulation quality, increase this number as much as possible without allowing visible amounts of overlap.

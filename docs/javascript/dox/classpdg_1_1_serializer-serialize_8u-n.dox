\fn pdg::Serializer::serialize_8u

\brief serialize 8 unsigned bytes

Write an eight byte value in the range of **0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615** into the data stream. 

\warning  JavaScript doesn't directly support 64-bit Integers, so for very large values expect some precision to be lost in the conversion between JavaScript's native double and 64-bit Integer. You might want to use serialize_d() instead.

\note data size: 8 bytes
